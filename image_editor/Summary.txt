SUMMARY
=======
Give your answer after each question and before the dashed lines, which you
should not remove. Your answers can be multiple lines. THANK YOU!

WHERE CAN WE FIND YOUR WORK ON GITHUB? Give the usernames of all teammates
and the URL of the repository. [1 point]

----------------------------------------

DID YOU SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING THAT WAS REQUESTED? Either answer
"Yes" or describe what you were and were not able to implement. [1 point]
Yes



----------------------------------------

DOES EVERYTHING WORK TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, AND DO ALL TESTS PASS?
If the answer is not "Yes", please state here which parts did not work and
which tests did not pass. [1 point]
Yes

----------------------------------------

WHAT WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME YOU SPENT ON THE ASSIGNMENT? Rather than
giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range. Use hours.
[1 point]
16 hours

----------------------------------------

WHO DID YOU WORK WITH AND HOW? Discussing the assignment with people not on
your team is fine as long as you don't share code. [1 point]
We worked with Samyutha Srinivisan during her drop in office hours on monday,
tuesday, and wednesday night to help us debug our project.

----------------------------------------

WHAT RESOURCES DID YOU USE? Please give specific URLs and state which ones
were particularly helpful. You do not need to cite course materials. [1 point]
We used ChatGPT inorder to help us better understand the BufferedImage class.
We also used chat to help us understand how to create files.

----------------------------------------

WHAT DATA STRUCTURES DID YOU CONSIDER, AND HOW DID YOU CHOOSE YOUR FINAL ONE? [3 points]
We used a 2D array because we had practice using them on a previous homework
assigment and we're more confident with this data structure. We didn't really
consider any other structures because we thought a 2D array would make
the most sense to us, given that an image can easily be represented as it.

----------------------------------------

GIVE ONE OR MORE PARAGRAPHS REFLECTING ON YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE
ASSIGNMENT, including answers to **all** of these questions:

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?
* In what ways was this better or worse than a regular homework assignment?

Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and
lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA or classmate who was especially helpful,
say so. [6 points]

Some the most difficult part of this assigment was the beginning. Understanding
how each class works together and Buffered Image class was a struggle for us.
But once we understood the already given code, it made the rest a lot easier.
Sorting through the data set was also a challenge at first. The most rewarding part
of the assignment was having ever function implemented correctly and work as intended.
Seeing the end result in the GUI felt very rewarding. This assigment taught us
more about the Buffered Image class, working with colors/pixels, and files. This
assigment was also good refactoring practice. This project was better than homework assignments
in the sense that we had to spend more time on it, so we understood the concepts a lot more.
It was also good because it incorporated a multitude of topics we learned in class,
while also giving us some control on how we coded our project (like choosing data structures).
Something that made the project worse is that it took a really long time for us
to understand the concept of the project before we could start coding it.
